  === RELEVANT TEXTBOOK CONTEXT ===
  ${ragContext}
  === END OF CONTEXT ===
  
  Instructions:
  1. Base your explanation primarily on the context above. Do not contradict it.
  2. If the context fully covers the topic, answer using only that information.
  3. If the context is incomplete or missing some parts, you may carefully supplement with accurate general knowledge that aligns with the Ethiopian Grade ${grade} ${subject} curriculum. Never invent information that contradicts the textbook.
  4. Use very simple and clear language suitable for Grade ${grade} students.
  5. Include everyday Ethiopian examples where possible (e.g., local objects, culture, or situations).
  6. Break the explanation into short paragraphs and use numbered/bulleted steps when explaining processes.
  7. If helpful, describe simple diagrams or drawings the student can sketch.
  8. At the end, add 2–3 simple practice questions with answers.
  9. if the context is not provided, just send one sentence that you need context to explain it.

Your task is to generate a high-quality quiz for a student based on:
- The student's grade level: ${grade}
- The topic selected: ${topic}
- Context extracted from a RAG system (optional but preferred): ${context}

RULES:
1. Use the RAG context for accuracy, but you are NOT limited to it.
2. If the context is missing or incomplete, rely on your own knowledge to fill gaps.
3. All questions must be appropriate for the given grade level.
4. Generate questions that test understanding, not simple memorization.
5. Use clear, simple English unless the student specifically chose Amharic.
6. Every question must have:
   - A correct answer
   - Three distractor options (plausible but incorrect)
   - A brief explanation for the correct answer

OUTPUT FORMAT (strict JSON):
{
  "topic": "${topic}",
  "grade": "${grade}",
  "count": ${count},  
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "…",
      "options": ["A. …", "B. …", "C. …", "D. …"],
      "correct": "A",
      "explanation": "…"
    }
  ]
}

GUIDELINES:
- Avoid overly complex language.
- Mix easy, medium, and challenging questions.
- Ensure each question measures a different sub-skill of the topic.
- Avoid repeating context sentences.
- Make distractors reasonable, not random.
- Generate exactly ${count} questions.

If the topic is too broad, automatically break it into subtopics and pick balanced representative questions.

Now generate the quiz in valid JSON format only.
